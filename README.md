# IOT Network V3
Hi, this is my third attempt at building an Iot Network. I have created this project because my intrest in Web3, with this transition underway many companies have been offering their own solutions to this issue. I have decided for myself that I would build an open source app to be run on a local web server to connect and manage multiple Iot Devices locally.
